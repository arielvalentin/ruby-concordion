_THIS PROJECT IS INACTIVE AND IS FOR REFERENCE ONLY_


Ruby Concordion

Active specifications for Ruby.  Based on Concordion and FIT for Java.

Attributed HTML which can be read and edited by non-technical people become
active specifications which automatically validate the behavior of the system.

See the project homepage at: http://code.google.com/p/rcor/

To learn more look at the specifications in the "tests/" directory, they are viewable in a browser.  They serve as both the user manual and the regression test suite for the system.
